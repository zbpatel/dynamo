# Metrics Visualization with Prometheus and Grafana

This directory contains configuration for visualizing metrics from the metrics aggregation service using Prometheus and Grafana.

## Components

- **Prometheus Server**: Collects and stores metrics from Dynamo services and other components.
- **Grafana**: Provides dashboards by querying the Prometheus Server.

The dcgm-exporter service in the Docker Compose network is configured to use port 9401 instead of the default port 9400. This adjustment is made to avoid port conflicts with other dcgm-exporter instances that may be running simultaneously. Such a configuration is typical in distributed systems like SLURM.

As of Q2 2025, Dynamo HTTP Frontend metrics are exposed when you build containers with `--framework VLLM` or `--framework TENSORRTLLM`.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system

2. Start Dynamo dependencies. Assume you're at the root dynamo path:

   ```bash
   # Start the basic services (etcd & natsd), along with Prometheus and Grafana
   docker compose -f deploy/metrics/docker-compose.yml --profile metrics up -d

   # Minimum components for Dynamo: etcd/nats/dcgm-exporter
   docker compose -f deploy/metrics/docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

   Optional: To target specific GPU(s), export the variable below before running Docker Compose
   ```bash
   export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,2
   ```

3. Web servers started. The ones that end in /metrics are in Prometheus format:
   - Grafana: `http://localhost:3001` (default login: dynamo/dynamo)
   - Prometheus Server: `http://localhost:9090`
   - NATS Server: `http://localhost:8222` (monitoring endpoints: /varz, /healthz, etc.)
   - NATS Prometheus Exporter: `http://localhost:7777/metrics`
   - etcd Server: `http://localhost:2379/metrics`
   - DCGM Exporter: `http://localhost:9401/metrics`

4. Optionally, if you want to experiment further, look through components/metrics/README.md for more details on launching a metrics server (subscribes to nats), mock_worker (publishes to nats), and real workers.

   - Start the [components/metrics](../../components/metrics/README.md) application to begin monitoring for metric events from dynamo workers and aggregating them on a Prometheus metrics endpoint: `http://localhost:9091/metrics`.
   - Uncomment the appropriate lines in prometheus.yml to poll port 9091.
   - Start worker(s) that publishes KV Cache metrics: [examples/rust/service_metrics/bin/server](../../lib/runtime/examples/service_metrics/README.md)` can populate dummy KV Cache metrics.


## Configuration

### Prometheus

The Prometheus configuration is specified in [prometheus.yml](./prometheus.yml). This file is set up to collect metrics from the metrics aggregation service endpoint.

Please be aware that you might need to modify the target settings to align with your specific host configuration and network environment.

After making changes to prometheus.yml, it is necessary to reload the configuration using the command below. Simply sending a kill -HUP signal will not suffice due to the caching of the volume that contains the prometheus.yml file.

```
docker compose -f deploy/metrics/docker-compose.yml up prometheus -d --force-recreate
```

### Grafana

Grafana is pre-configured with:
- Prometheus datasource
- Sample dashboard for visualizing service metrics
![grafana image](./grafana-dynamo-composite.png)

## Required Files

The following configuration files should be present in this directory:
- [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml): Defines the Prometheus and Grafana services
- [prometheus.yml](./prometheus.yml): Contains Prometheus scraping configuration
- [grafana-datasources.yml](./grafana-datasources.yml): Contains Grafana datasource configuration
- [grafana_dashboards/grafana-dashboard-providers.yml](./grafana_dashboards/grafana-dashboard-providers.yml): Contains Grafana dashboard provider configuration
- [grafana_dashboards/grafana-dynamo-dashboard.json](./grafana_dashboards/grafana-dynamo-dashboard.json): A general Dynamo Dashboard for both SW and HW metrics.
- [grafana_dashboards/grafana-dcgm-metrics.json](./grafana_dashboards/grafana-dcgm-metrics.json): Contains Grafana dashboard configuration for DCGM GPU metrics
- [grafana_dashboards/grafana-llm-metrics.json](./grafana_dashboards/grafana-llm-metrics.json): This file, which is being phased out, contains the Grafana dashboard configuration for LLM-specific metrics. It requires an additional `metrics` component to operate concurrently. A new version is under development.

## Running the example `metrics` component

IMPORTANT: This section is being phased out, and some metrics may not function as expected. A new solution is under development.

When you run the example [components/metrics](../../components/metrics/README.md) component, it exposes a Prometheus /metrics endpoint with the followings (defined in [../../components/metrics/src/lib.rs](../../components/metrics/src/lib.rs)):
- `llm_requests_active_slots`: Number of currently active request slots per worker
- `llm_requests_total_slots`: Total available request slots per worker
- `llm_kv_blocks_active`: Number of active KV blocks per worker
- `llm_kv_blocks_total`: Total KV blocks available per worker
- `llm_kv_hit_rate_percent`: Cumulative KV Cache hit percent per worker
- `llm_load_avg`: Average load across workers
- `llm_load_std`: Load standard deviation across workers

## Troubleshooting

1. Verify services are running:
  ```bash
  docker compose ps
  ```

2. Check logs:
  ```bash
  docker compose logs prometheus
  docker compose logs grafana
  ```
